## Overview

Comprehensive Simulation Suite: LabUtopia introduces a high-fidelity simulation and benchmarking platform tailored for scientific embodied agents, integrating LabSim, LabScene, and LabBench to support complex laboratory tasks.
- **LabSim**: A high-fidelity simulator built on Isaac Sim, enhanced with a chemical engine to model reaction-driven transformations (e.g., color changes, product generation), enabling precise simulation of physical and chemical interactions.
- **LabScene**: A procedural generation pipeline that creates diverse, physically plausible 3D laboratory scenes with over 100 laboratory scenes and 100 instrument assets, verified by domain experts for realistic training environments.
- **LabBench**: A hierarchical benchmark with five levels of task complexity, spanning from atomic manipulations to long-horizon mobile manipulation tasks, covering 30 distinct tasks for rigorous evaluation of embodied agents.
